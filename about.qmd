I am a data science enthusiast with a strong interest in data visualization and real-world applications of AI. You can find more of my work on Github (https://github.com/NeelamArshad) or reach me at aneelam888@gmail.com. 

This project, which focuses on analyzing US traffic accidents to uncover patterns and insights using real-world data, is available on GitHub(https://neelamarshad.github.io/us-traffic-accidents/).

This project was created as a part of [Kaneâ€™s Data Science Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/).
