This dataset includes detailed information on over 7 million traffic accidents across the United States, covering variables such as location, time, weather conditions, and accident severity.\nTo prepare the data for analysis, I selected a manageable subset of the full dataset to avoid memory issues and improve performance. Basic data cleaning was performed, including handling missing values, parsing dates and times, and selecting relevant variables for visualization and analysis. No major filtering or removal of observations was done beyond these standard preprocessing steps."

    "text": "Traffic accidents in the United States show distinct patterns based on the time of day. Using data from the US Accidents dataset, which includes detailed records of traffic incidents from 2016 to 2023, I analyzed a sample of 100,000 accident reports to explore temporal and environmental trends in accident frequency and severity. The number of accidents rises sharply starting at 5 AM, peaks during the morning commute between 7 and 9 AM, and shows another increase in the late afternoon, reflecting typical workday travel patterns. This analysis reveals that daily human activity and traffic density play a significant role in when accidents are most likely to occur. I also modeled the severity of traffic accidents using a linear regression model fit on 2 million records. Key predictors included the time of day the accident began, the distance covered by the accident, and the weather conditions at the time of the incident. Accidents that occurred in adverse weather conditions, such as snow, rain, or fog, tended to be slightly more severe. Likewise, accidents that spanned longer distances were also associated with modest increases in severity. This model and its findings may be valuable for transportation planners, policymakers, and researchers aiming to understand the impact of environmental and situational factors on accident severity and improve road safety strategies."

    "text": "To understand the factors contributing to the severity of traffic accidents in the United States, I fit a linear regression model using a sample of 2 million accident records from the US Accidents dataset (2016–2023).\nThe response variable was Severity, which ranges from 1 (least severe) to 4 (most severe). The predictors included:\nStart Time: The time of day when the accident began\nDistance: The distance the accident covered, in miles\nWeather Condition: The reported weather at the time of the accident"

While statistically significant, the magnitude is negligible, suggesting limited practical influence.\nWeather Conditions:\nClear and Foggy conditions are associated with lower severity compared to the baseline category (possibly “Overcast” or another default in the model).\nLight Snow shows a slight increase in severity, though the effect is not statistically significant.\nHeavy Rain has a positive coefficient, indicating increased severity, but the effect is only marginally significant (p ≈ 0.075).\nOverall, the model indicates that certain weather conditions and distance covered play more meaningful roles in predicting accident severity, while the time of day has only a minor effect."
