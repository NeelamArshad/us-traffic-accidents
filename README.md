## Project Overview

This project analyzes traffic accidents in the United States using data from the [US Accidents (2016 - 2023)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents) dataset. The analysis focuses on understanding the patterns and trends of accidents by time of day, location, and other relevant factors.

Key features of the project include:
- Visualizations of accident frequency by hour of day
- Exploratory analysis of various accident-related variables
- Clean and reproducible code using R and Quarto

The main goal is to provide insights that could help in understanding when and where accidents are most likely to occur.
